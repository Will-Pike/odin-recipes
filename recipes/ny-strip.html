    <h1>Grilled New York Strip Steaks</h1>
    <img src="images/ny-strip.jpg">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This method of cooking steaks on the grill is pure genius and I learned it from a master – Mark Lobel. Lobel’s of New York is a fifth generation butcher shop on Madison Avenue and it’s one of the top butchers in the country. I seasoned these steaks with a rub that Mark taught me but the real secret is in his grilling method. Perfect steak every time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coffee (regular or decaf)</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon (dried) granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>3 (1½-inch-thick) New York strip steaks or “club steaks”</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons good olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, the brown sugar, coffee, garlic, chipotle powder, and red pepper flakes.   </li>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels, place them in a baking dish, and rub them all over with the olive oil.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the steaks all over with the spice mix, using it all.  </li>
        <li>Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to get into the meat. </li>
        <li>When ready to cook, heat enough charcoal to cover half of the grill (I fill a charcoal chimney ¾ full). </li>
        <li>Pour a layer of hot coals on one side of the grill, leaving the other side empty.</li>
        <li>Cook the steaks on the hot side of the grill for exactly 2 minutes on one side, turn them over, and cook for exactly 2 minutes on the other side. </li>
        <li>Move the steaks to the cool side of the grill, put the lid on, check to be sure the vents are open, and cook for 8 to10 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted sideways into the middle of the steak registers between 115 degrees for rare, and 120 degrees for medium-rare, and 125 degrees for medium.</li>
        <li>Transfer the steaks to a plate, cover the plate tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 15 minutes.  </li>
        <li> Remove the foil after 15 minutes or the steaks will continue to cook!</li>
        <li>Slice the steaks, sprinkle with salt, and serve hot or warm.</li>
    </ol>
