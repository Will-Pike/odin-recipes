        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Add the ground sirloin and cook, crumbling the meat with a wooden spoon. </li>
        <li>Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat has lost its pink color and has started to brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, oregano, and hot red pepper flakes and cook for one minute. </li>
        <li>Pour the wine into the skillet and stir to scrape up any browned bits. </li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1½ teaspoons pepper, stirring until combined. </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add a tablespoon of salt and the pasta and cook according to the directions on the box.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, finish the sauce.  Add the nutmeg, basil, and cream to the sauce and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>When the pasta is cooked, transfer it with a slotted spoon or sieve to the pan with the sauce, saving the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Cook for one minute, add the remaining ¼ cup of wine, and cooking liquid, if necessary to make enough sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with Parmesan on the side.</li>
